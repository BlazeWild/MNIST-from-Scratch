# MNIST-from-Scratch
## This is MNIST model using numpy only <br>
<hr> 
<h2> Training a model includes: </h2> <br>

- Initializing parameters
- Forward propagation
- Computing loss
- Back propagation
- Updating paramters<br>

The parameters obtained are forward prpagated to X_test.And accuracy is calculated by comparing it to y_label
